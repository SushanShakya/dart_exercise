If you want to contribute to this repo you must do one of the folowing:

## 1. Create class content and Create Homework

In this case,<br> You will create a class file.<br> For example :<br>

```
class_for_loops.md
```

and add Dart Programming content to the class file with following format:

```
# Class <Name-of-class>

## For Loops // Topic Here

<Content-Here>
```

then, you will also create a Homework for the class file inside `homeworks/` folder. For Example:

```
homeworks/class_for_loops_hw.md
```

and add homeworks for that particular class with following format:

```
# Class <Name-of-class>

## Homework

## 2. Add Questions to existing Homework Problems

You should only add questions related to if-else statements in this file.
