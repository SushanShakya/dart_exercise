> Program to check if the sum of 2 numbers is a third number.

> Program to print "Okay" if the sum of 2 numbers is 10 otherwise print "Sick"

> Program to check if a number is odd or even.

> Program to print "Badass" if the number is even otherwise print "Dumb".

> Program to check if a number is divisible by 3.

> Program to check if a number has quotient > 0.

> Program to check the greater among 2 numbers and print the greater number.

> Program to check the smaller among 2 numbers print the smaller number.

> Program to check the greater among 3 numbers print the greater number.

> Program to check the smaller among 3 numbers print the smaller number.

> Program to check if a number is a multiple of another numbers.

> Let's say you're writing a small piece of Facebook.
> Your task is to write a logic to check if some content should be visible
> on a person's facebook or not.
> It should be visible if the person is the friend of the post creator.
> Assume you'll be given a variable saying whether the creator is a friend or not.
> If creator is a friend print "SHOW CONTENT" otherwise print "SKIP"

> Let's say you have to write a small piece of Youtube.
> Your task is to write the logic to see if the video is appropriate for children.
> If the video is flagged as above 18 then it's not appropriate so print "NOT APPROPRIATE"
> Otherwise print "APPROPRIATE".
> Assume that you'll be given a variable whether a video is appropriate or not.

> You're writing a small logic to shopping cart. You know the remaining number of apples (Let's say 10)
> and a person wants to buy 11 apples. This is not allowed. Write program to do the check and print
> "Not Allowed" if a person wants to buy more apples than is available in the inventory otherwise
> pring "Allowed"

> You're writing a 2v2 game. Your task is to check whose HP is greater among the 2 players competing.
> Assume that first player's health is 100 and second player's health is 120. The one with the larger health is the winner.

> A person passes his exams if his score is greater than 32. Program to check whether a student passes his exam or not.

> A person is said to be young if he is in his 20s, mid-age if he is in his 30s and old if he is in his 40s.
> Write a program to check if the a person is young, mid-age or old. If he is mid age print "SEXY" otherwise
> print "SEUCY".

> There are 3 types of people in the world.
>
> 1. People without money
> 2. People with some money
> 3. Rich People
>
> You will categorize then using their score.
>
> 1. People without money (score < 100)
> 2. People with some money (score >= 100 and score <200)
> 3. Rich People (score > 200)
>
> Write a program to do this.

> Students are arranged in a format such that odd numbers are girls and even numbers are boys.
> Write a program to check whether a given number is a boy or a girl. If it is a boy you should print "Boy"
> otherwise print "Girl".

> A Player can proceed to the next level if he has a score greather than 800.
> Write a program to check if a player can proceed to the next level.

> Let's say you're programming a small part of Mobile Legends.
> Your game divides a player as: "Warrior", "Elite", "Grandmaster", "Epic", "Legend", "Mythic"
> based on number of stars you've obtained.
> Write logic given number of stars to check which group the player belongs to.
> Warrior : At least 10 stars
> Elite : At least 20 stars
> Grandmaster : At least 30 stars
> Epic : At least 40 stars
> Legend : At least 50 stars
> Mythic : More than 60 stars

> Assume that you're writing code for self driving train.
> Your task is to write a small logic for when the train comes across a 2 way track.
> Your train is supposed to reach Guwahati.
> Left track takes you to Amritsar.
> Right track takes you to Guwahati.
> Create the variables and check which track you should go to.

> Program to print "Fizz" if a number is divisible by 3,
> print "Buzz" if a number is divisible by 5
> and print "FizzBuzz" if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
