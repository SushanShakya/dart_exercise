1. > Let's say you're writing a small piece of Facebook.<br>
   > Your task is to write a logic to check if some content should be visible<br>
   > on a person's facebook or not.<br>
   > It should be visible if the person is the friend of the post creator.<br>
   > Assume you'll be given a variable saying whether the creator is a friend or not.<br>
   > If creator is a friend print "SHOW CONTENT" otherwise print "SKIP"

1. > Let's say you have to write a small piece of Youtube.<br>
   > Your task is to write the logic to see if the video is appropriate for children.<br>
   > If the video is flagged as above 18 then it's not appropriate so print "NOT APPROPRIATE"<br>
   > Otherwise print "APPROPRIATE".<br>
   > Assume that you'll be given a variable whether a video is appropriate or not.

1. > You're writing a small logic to shopping cart. You know the remaining number of apples (Let's say 10)<br>
   > and a person wants to buy 11 apples. This is not allowed. Write program to do the check and print<br>
   > "Not Allowed" if a person wants to buy more apples than is available in the inventory otherwise<br>
   > pring "Allowed"<br>

1. > You're writing a 2v2 game. Your task is to check whose HP is greater among the 2 players competing.<br>
   > Assume that first player's health is 100 and second player's health is 120. The one with the larger health is the winner.<br>

1. > A person passes his exams if his score is greater than 32.<br>
   > Program to check whether a student passes his exam or not.

1. > A person is said to be young if he is in his 20s, mid-age if he is in his 30s and old if he is in his 40s.<br>
   > Write a program to check if the a person is young, mid-age or old. If he is mid age print "SEXY" otherwise<br>
   > print "SEUCY".<br>
   >
   > There are 3 types of people in the world.<br>
   >
   > 1. People without money<br>
   > 2. People with some money<br>
   > 3. Rich People<br>
   >
   > You will categorize then using their score.<br>
   >
   > 1. People without money (score < 100)<br>
   > 2. People with some money (score >= 100 and score <200)<br>
   > 3. Rich People (score 1. > 200)<br>
   >
   > Write a program to do this.<br>

1. > Students are arranged in a format such that odd numbers are girls and even numbers are boys.<br>
   > Write a program to check whether a given number is a boy or a girl. If it is a boy you should print "Boy"<br>
   > otherwise print "Girl".

1. > A Player can proceed to the next level if he has a score greather than 800.<br>
   > Write a program to check if a player can proceed to the next level.

1. > Let's say you're programming a small part of Mobile Legends.<br>
   > Your game divides a player as: "Warrior", "Elite", "Grandmaster", "Epic", "Legend", "Mythic"<br>
   > based on number of stars you've obtained.<br>
   > Write logic given number of stars to check which group the player belongs to.<br>
   > Warrior : At least 10 stars<br>
   > Elite : At least 20 stars<br>
   > Grandmaster : At least 30 stars<br>
   > Epic : At least 40 stars<br>
   > Legend : At least 50 stars<br>
   > Mythic : More than 60 stars<br>

1. > Assume that you're writing code for self driving train.<br>
   > Your task is to write a small logic for when the train comes across a 2 way track.<br>
   > Your train is supposed to reach Guwahati.<br>
   > Left track takes you to Amritsar.<br>
   > Right track takes you to Guwahati.<br>
   > Create the variables and check which track you should go to.<br>

1. > Program to print "Fizz" if a number is divisible by 3,<br>
   > print "Buzz" if a number is divisible by 5<br>
   > and print "FizzBuzz" if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.<br>
