## Variables

Programming Structure to store different types of data.

Common Data Types of variables:

1. int
2. double
3. bool
4. String

The Variables can represent anything:

For example:

If you're programming a game,
It may represent the current score

<pre>
int currentScore = 100;
</pre>

If you're programming a shopping cart,
It may represent the total cost.

<pre>
double totalCostInRupees = 100;
</pre>

If you're programming argument between husband and wife.<br>
It may represent if the husband is correct or not.

<pre>
bool isHusbandCorrect = false;
</pre>

It can represent statements said by famous people.

<pre>
String einsteinQuote = "E = mc^2";
</pre>

### Variables can be written in an easy way if we have a simpler denotation for it

So, Variable can be created as follows as well:

<pre>
var currentScore = 100;
var totalCostInRupees = 100;
var isHusbandCorrect = false;
var einsteinQuote = "E = mc^2";
</pre>

Here, you're telling dart to figure out the data type for itself.

## Collections

Creating multiple varibles for multiple numbers is boring<br>
and takes too much time.

So, we use multiple values from a single variables using<br>
collection.

Common Types of Collection:

1. List
2. Set

For example:

Let's say you're programming a game where the hero has to kill <br>
a lot of enemies.<br>

You can store the healths of all the enemies using a List.

<pre>
List<int> enemyHealths = [100, 200, 100, 150, 50];
</pre>

You can store all your groceries.

<pre>
List<String> groceries = ["Apple", "Onion", "Cabbage"];
</pre>

You can store all your marks.

<pre>
List<double> marks = [50, 30.5, 10.5, 100];
</pre>
