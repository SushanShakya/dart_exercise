## Arithmetic Operations (int and double)

Computers are normally used to manipulate numbers.<br>
This is done in programming using arithmetic operators:

1. Add (+)
2. Substract (-)
3. Multiply (\*)
4. Divide (/)
5. Modulus (%)
6. Integer Division (~/)

## Arithmetic operation with numbers

You can do arithmetics with number like you used to do in school.

<pre>
int a = 2;
int b = 10;

print(a + b);
print(a - b);
print(a * b);
print(a / b);
print(a ~/ b);
print(a % b);
</pre>

## Arithmetic operation with Strings

You can use (+) operator with Strings.
This is known as String concatenation.

<pre>
String a = "Hello, ";
String b = "World";

print(a + b); // String Concatenation
</pre>

Repeat the word "Concatenation" multiple time and <br>
use it everytime to remember the word
